            It's been about 3 years since I quit my traditional
            in-office job and started working from a co-working space
            for a remote-friendly company. In that time I've gotten a
            lot of questions from folks about it, and the most common
            questions tend to focus on how to get started as a remote
            worker.
          </p>

          <p>Let's talk about how to find a remote gig.</p>

              Evaluating friendliness

          </h2>

          <p>
            It's very easy for companies to add "remote work" as a
            keyword to a job listing, but it's much harder for
            companies to create policies and culture that treat remote
            workers well.
          </p>

          <p>
            The first question I always ask when trying to evaluate an
            organization: what % of the company is remote?
          </p>
          <p>
            If the company only has one or two remote workers, it's
            almost a guarantee that all elements of the culture are
            biased for in-office workers. These kinds of arrangements
            can still work, but it's a much steeper hill to climb. By
            contrast, some organizations are fully distributed - they
            have no head office, every employee works from their own
            environment. Entire categories of problems evaporate with
            this kind of arrangement.
          </p>
          <p>
            A bonus question you can ask: is the company
            remote-friendly "all the way up"? Are there members of the
            exec team working remotely, or is it only individual
            contributors who work remotely? In my experience, it's a
            bit of a yellow flag if remote workers aren't spread
            across the org chart, including management and senior
            leadership.
          </p>
          <h2>
            <span class="heading-decoration"></span>
            <span class="heading-content"> Remote integration </span>
          </h2>
          <p>
            If the company is not fully distributed, it's important to
            figure out whether remote work is treated as a first-class
            concern, or whether it's an afterthought. When designing
            company policies, are remote workers top-of-mind? Is
            remote work a core part of the culture?
          </p>
          <h2>
            <span class="heading-decoration"></span>
            <span class="heading-content"> Meetings </span>
          </h2>
          <p>
            If a company is 50% remote, it means that a 10-person
            meeting will typically include 5 people in the same space,
            and 5 folks calling in. This can produce an awkward
            dynamic, where the employees in the same room are more
            likely to talk with each other. If there are no lulls in
            the conversation, it can be hard to jump in as a remote
            participant.
          </p>
          <p>There are a couple strategies for mitigating this:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              A remote champion can be designated. This in-office
              person is responsible for keeping an eye on the chat,
              and interjecting if it looks like a remote participant
              has something to say, and making sure to explicitly
              check in with remote folks every few minutes for
              comments.
            </li>
            <li>
              Everyone in the meeting can call in from their own
              device. This way, even if folks are in the same room
              together, they're all communicating through a screen,
              same as remote participants. This can level the playing
              field a bit.
